# Code Sample
Sample code of a news feed feature which displays a list of most recent posts/reposts with extended functionality to allow a user to comment/like any visible posts. The feed is populated by retrieving all posts created by the currently logged in user as well as all posts created by his or her connections. This sample will primarily focus on commenting & reposting components.

Note this is just a code sample and is only meant to showcase general functionality of a feature.
